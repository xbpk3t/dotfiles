# System limits and performance tuning
# Migrated from ansible/roles/common/tasks/ulimit.yml

{
  # System limits configuration (equivalent to ansible ulimit.yml)
  # Note: Implementation is platform-specific:
  # - Darwin: launchd.user.agents or system-wide limits
  # - NixOS: security.pam.loginLimits and boot.kernel.sysctl

  # Common limits that should be applied:
  # - nofile (open files): 1048576
  # - nproc (processes): varies by environment

  # Platform-specific implementations will be in platform modules
